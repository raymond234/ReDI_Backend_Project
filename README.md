# ReDI_Backend_Project: Hangman built with Python and Flask.

Frontend: Python. Console. 
Location: main:Hangman_Logic

Backend: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy(SQLite)
Location: main:Flask_Backend

Short Description: 
This is my personal version of the popular Hangman word game. This hangman console game is still under construction. Leave taken to focus on academics and exams. 
The game is currently functional. Run main.py in the frontend and main.py in the backend.
Deployment to Heroku and further development to implement exceptions, tests and extensive code documentation will happen in the nearest future.

Thank you.
